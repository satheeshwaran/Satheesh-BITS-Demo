/**
 
 A ESTBeaconRegion object defines a type of region that is based on the deviceâ€™s proximity to a Bluetooth beacon, as opposed to a geographic location. A beacon region looks for devices whose identifying information matches the information you provide. When that device comes in range, the region triggers the delivery of an appropriate notification.
